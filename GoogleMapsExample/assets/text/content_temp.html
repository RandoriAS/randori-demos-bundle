    <div><p>So, let's try and explain how everything works here.</p>
        <p>Remember, on github.com/darscan/robotlegs/tree/master you can read more about the framework.</p>
        <span class='mbold'>First things first.</span>
        <p>The project is a FlashBuilder AS3-project using SDK4.0.0 build 7219.
            It is set to build in /web/assets/swf/ and opens the index.html in /web
            if you debug the project. The index.html embeds a loader.swf and it loads
            the swf we compile with FlashBuilder. The View (component) classes in
            the code embed graphical assets (movieclips) from fla files (Flash CS4).
            These are set to publish in src/main/flash/assets/swf/. If you change
            things in the fla's, compile in the Flash IDE and debug the project in
            FlashBuilder to see the changes. The Googlemap uses a custom marker.
            Its View class embeds a .png that resides in src/main/flash/assets/bitmaps/.
            One thing to mention: I used the word component. No, I don't mean a full
            fledged AS3 Component. In the contexts of the framework we merely use the
            word component to make a distinction between the Mediator and the view
            component it mediates.</p>
        <p>The basic idea is to show how the framework
            is used to consume content like xml and a service. And (of course) how to
            set and change the state using events. On the Googlemap I show some pubs
            in our country with corresponding entries under the 'Tips' tab in the main
            navigation. Clicking on one of the markers triggers an event in the View
            component and its Mediator handles the event by calling the (Googlemaps API)
            service. The Mediator receives the result from the service and changes the
            state of the View component via its API. To demonstrate how to 'communicate'
            between the main content pane and the Googlemap (these two 'components' are
            obviously unaware of each other) the tips will 'trigger' an event when clicked
            and cause the Googlemap to change its state.<br/><br/>Within the main content
            pane the main navigation is a seperate component. It merely triggers an event
            when one of the tabs is clicked. The event carries an id and the Mediator
            that 'governs' the content view component uses this id to show the correct
            content from the xml.</p>
        <p>Ok, that pretty much wraps it up. Last thing to mention: this is a work in
            progress so I'll probably refactor some things, so check back if you want
            to have the latest version. And now:<p>
            <span class='link'><a href='event:showTips'>Show me the best pubs >></a></span></div>

        <p>Some words on how the code works.</p>
        <p>Everything is a choice, right? I've just made some choices in the design
            to show how the framework does its job. For instance, in this demo I'm

            you must provide is the container that holds all Sprites and Movieclips
            you want to put on the stage - see  <span>FlashGoogleMaps.as</span>

            freaking cool. Let's summarize the basic actors in this demo:</p>
         <p>FlashGoogleMaps.as - serves as the Document Class<br/>
             FlashGoogleMapsContext.as - initializes the framework<br/>PrepViewCommand.as - map View components to
             Mediators<br/>
             PrepModelCommand.as - 'save' the model parts we will need<br/>
             PrepControllerCommand - map some Commands to events<br/>
             StartupCommand.as - add some Sprites to fire up this thing.</p>
        <span class='mbold'>The Views and Mediators.</span>
        <p>Ok, with the basic actors in place we can add our Views and do something
            with the Model. As said, I'm dropping a GoogleMapsView on the stage. The
            framework detects this action and automatically provides the GoogleMapsMediator
            thanks to the mapping we did. Have a look at the GoogleMapsMediator. It listens
            for the GoogleMapsView.GOOGLEMAP_READY event fired by the GoogleMapsView. Once
            that events fires, handleGoogleMapReady() gets called and that's when I load
            the xml-file that contains the data for the markers and all other content. To
            load the xml (a Model related job) we dispatch an event that is mapped to the
            LoadXMLCommand. The GoogleMapsMediator obviously wants to know when the xml is
            loaded so it registers for AssetLoaderProxyEvent.XML_CONTENT_LOADED which will be
            fired by AssetLoaderProxy. Once the event fires handleXMLContentLoaded() modifies
            GoogleMapsView via its API. And that - basically - is it!</p>
        <p>Ok, that was way more than 'some words', but you have to agree it's easy stuff
            and all you need to know to start coding with RobotLegs. Yes, there is more
            but once you are on your way you will discover and learn the more involved
            aspects of the framework.</p>

    <content type="how"><![CDATA[<font color='#b30d0d' size='21'>

        <div>
            <p>How about the nitty gritty?</p>
            <p>We have the basics covered and the purpose of this demo is to show
                just how easy it is to work with RobotLegs, but maybe I should explain
                some design choices in the code.</p>
            <span class='mbold'>The Mediators.</span>
            <p>I could have done the demo with three Mediators:</p>
            <p>GoogleMapsMediator, ContentViewMediator, TabViewMediator, mediating the
                three 'major' views in the demo.</p>
            <p>In this setup the ContentView, representing the content pane, could listen
                to events from its view parts (PlainTextView and TipView(s)) and let the
                ContentMediator handle those events. Let's look at the tips. What we need
                here is that a click on the tip makes the Googlemap zoom in on the location
                and show the lay over with some information on the selected pub. The
                ContentView must listen for the event from the TipView(s) and let its
                Mediator know about this so the framework can notify the GoogleMapsMediator
                of the request. Let's say this works but it clutters the code in the
                ContentView. In comes that nifty feature again where RobotLegs detects
                new children on the stage. The moment the ContentView adds TipView(s)
                to the display list, RobotLegs makes sure there is a Mediator (provided
                we did the mapping!). This makes sense right? The dynamically created
                TipViewMediators now handle the click event and 'directly' inform the
                GooglemapsMediator. And yes, if we remove a child, RobotLegs removes
                the associated Mediator for us.</p>
            <p>So, what about a Mediator for the SmartInfoWindow? I'll leave that
                up to you if you don't mind.</p>
            <span>The content.</span>
            <p>There are so many ways to parse, save and distribute the (xml) content
                and it is beyond the scope of this demo to discuss this. I decided to
                use VO's for the markers on the Googlemap because this makes it much
                easier to work with (this is pretty much the way I would handle a result
                from a remoting gateway). Yes, you can also skip the VO stuff all
                together and just parse the tips in the GoogleView, or whatever approach
                you feel comfortable with. One thing to note on my VO approach: it is
                not really the Mediator way of doing things. You should be able to (re)use
                the view component as is in another project. Meaning, using its API,
                provide it with data and be done with it. The dependency on the VO's
                prevents this. Just so you know.</p>
            <span>The events.</span>
            <p>I can hear you thinking, 'do we need all these events'? Technically, no.
                You could do with a generic event that can carry optional data. Downside:
                it means casting stuff all over the place and that's one of the things
                RobotLegs is not promoting. Bottom line: it's a matter of choice.</p>
            <span>Final words.</span>
            <p>Found any flaws in the code? You know a better way to do things? Let me
                know. Join the RobotLegs AS3 Discussion Group,
                http://groups.google.com/group/robotlegs, and drop a message.</p>
            <p>I hope this demo helped you to get going with RobotLegs in a Flash AS3
                environment. And I wish you happy coding!</p>
