The machine would then examine the lock, figure out its combination and open the safe. In addition, the device sports an Olivetti wet-type photocopier that could allow for easy copying of secret documents to minimise the chance of the owner learning of the break in by missing documents. Wet-type photocopiers are actually unsuitable for field missions because they must not be tilted lest the highly toxic transfer liquid spills out. This device is quite slow, taking close to an hour to open a safe."
